# Password Strength Checker

This Python script helps assess the strength of a password by checking the following criteria:
- Length of the password (between 8 and 20 characters)
- Inclusion of at least one uppercase letter
- Inclusion of at least one lowercase letter
- Inclusion of at least one number
- Inclusion of at least one special character

The script provides feedback on each of these criteria and gives an overall assessment of the password's strength.

## Features
- Validates if the password is within the acceptable length.
- Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Provides clear feedback on each aspect of the password.
- Offers an overall assessment of the password's strength.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-assessor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd password-strength-assessor
   ```

## Usage
To use the password strength assessor, simply run the script and enter a password when prompted:

```bash
python password_strength_assessor.py
```

You will receive feedback on the strength of your password based on the criteria outlined.

## Example
Here's an example of how the script works:

```bash
Enter a password to assess: My$ecur3P@ssw0rd

## TASK 5 : Network Packet Analyzer

Overview

This repository contains the code for a Network Packet Analyzer developed during a recent project at Prodigy Infotech. The tool is designed to capture and analyze network packets, providing detailed insights into network traffic, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. The primary focus of this project is to ensure the ethical use of network analysis for educational and security purposes.

##Features

- Packet Capture: Intercept and capture live network packets.
- Protocol Analysis: Identify and categorize network protocols.
- Data Inspection: Inspect the payload of captured packets for detailed analysis.
- User-Friendly Interface: Command-line interface for easy interaction and operation.
- Ethical Use: Emphasis on ethical hacking practices and responsible use of network analysis tools.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `scapy` or any other necessary network analysis libraries

### Steps

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-packet-analyzer.git
   cd network-packet-analyzer
   ```

2. Install Dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Analyzer

   ```bash
   python packet_analyzer.py
   ```

## Usage

To start analyzing network packets, simply run the script as shown above. The tool will begin capturing packets from the network interface and display the analysis in the terminal. You can customize the capture filters and analysis parameters within the code to suit your specific needs.

## Example Output

Here is an example of what the output might look like:

```
[INFO] Capturing packets...
[INFO] Packet captured: Source IP: 192.168.1.2, Destination IP: 192.168.1.1, Protocol: TCP
[INFO] Analyzing packet data...
[INFO] Payload: (Hexadecimal or ASCII representation of the packet data)
```

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the tool are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request.
